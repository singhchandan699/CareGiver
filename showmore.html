  <h2 style="color: black"><center>INTRODUCTION</center></h2><br>
  <h4 style="color: white">A caregiver or carer is an unpaid or paid member of a person's social network who helps them with activities of daily living. Caregiving is most commonly used to address impairments related to old age, disability, a disease, or a mental disorder.<br><br>

Typical duties of a caregiver might include taking care of someone who has a chronic illness or disease; managing medications or talking to doctors and nurses on someone's behalf; helping to bathe or dress someone who is frail or disabled; or taking care of household chores, meals, or bills for someone who cannot do these things alone.<br><br>

With an increasingly aging population in all developed societies, the role of caregiver has been increasingly recognized as an important one, both functionally and economically. Many organizations which provide support for persons with disabilities have developed various forms of support for carers as well.</h4>
  <br>
  <h2 style="color: black"><center>BASIC PRINCIPLES</center></h2><br>
  <h4 style="color: white">A fundamental part of giving care is being a good communicator with the person getting care. Care is given with respect for the dignity of the person receiving care.The carer remains in contact with the primary health care provider, often a doctor or nurse, and helps the person receiving care make decisions about their health and matters affecting their daily life.<BR><br>

In the course of giving care, the caregiver is responsible for managing hygiene of themselves, the person receiving care, and the living environment.Hand washing for both caregivers and persons receiving care happen often. If the person receiving care is producing sharps waste from regular injections then the caregiver should manage that. Surfaces of the living area should be regularly cleaned and wiped and laundry managed.<br><br>

The caregiver manages organization of the person's agenda. Of special importance is helping the person meet medical appointments.Also routine daily living functions are scheduled, like managing hygiene tasks and keeping health care products available.</h4><br><br>
